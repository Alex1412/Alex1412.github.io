				<p>InnoHome Co., IHC is an european company, created in 2014, by the merge of 6 companies. The merge was caract√©rised by the fact that those compagnies needed co-developping, rather than creating and selling on one's own.</p>
				<p>It's at that time that the CEO and main investor Alexandre Robert realized that what those sellers and ingeneer needed, was an interface, a brand, something bigger than an individual project.</p>
				<p>So in 2014, everyone was gathering up for the first time, and we came up with three main serices or pack.</p>
			<h1 class="page-title">Our partners</h1>
				<p>Today more than never, we are not alone. Willing to insure a fully automated home, we hade to find new partners, companies who could be willing to work with use.</p>
				<p>This gives use the abality to offer low prices for starter packs in one hand. And in the other hand, some very complete and more costly solutions.</p>
				<p>Discover a large choice of partners. Some are integrated to our products and main providers. But others are specialized in equipements, software, security, etc.</p>
